### Tips
Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you to figure out how to use `hungry` and `availabletime` inside your function, try outputting their value to the terminal as follows.
```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime){
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
  }
  ```
